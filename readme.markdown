# Purpose

This repository contains my Javascript exercises when I was a student at CodeCore's web development bootcamp (www.codecore.ca).

# Loop through multi dimensional array

Given a multi dimensional array

> var my_array = [[2,3,4], ["Hello CodeCore", 1, true]];

Print to the console each element of the array.

# FizzBuzz

Write a function that takes two numbers and it then prints "fizz" if the number is divisible by the first number and "buzz" if the number is divisible by the second number and fizzbuzz if it's divisible by both.

# Largest number in an array

Build a function that takes an array and return the largest number. If there are no number in it, it should return "there are no numbers". It should accept an array with any type of objects.

# Personable Persons

Create two person objects with an "age" attribute and a "name" attribute.

Add a "greet" method to both people that accepts a person as a parameter and outputs the following:

> "Hello, [name]. I am [name]. Pleased to meet you." if the other person is older than this person.
> "Yo [name]. I'm totally [name]. Wsup!." if the other person is younger than this person.

# Decaying Count

Write some code that writes "1" to the console, then 1 second later writes "2" to the console, then 2 seconds after that writes "3" to the console, ..., until it gets to "10".
