<!-- 
- Create two person objects with an "age" attribute and a "name" attribute.

- Add a "greet" method to both people that accepts a person as a parameter and outputs the following:

"Hello, [name]. I am [name]. Pleased to meet you." if the other person is older than this person.
"Yo [name]. I'm totally [name]. Wsup!." if the other person is older than this person. -->
